CTraps is a gcc plugin and runtime library that inserts calls to runtime
library functions just before shared memory accesses in parallel/concurrent
code.

The purpose of this plugin is to expose information about when and how threads
communicate with one another to programmers for the purpose of debugging and
performance tuning.  The overhead of the instrumentation and runtime code is
very low -- often low enough for always-on use in production code.  In a series
of initial experiments the overhead was 0-10% in many important cases.

The provided runtime implementation has several modes:

1)Collect "last writer slices".  A Last writer slice is a table that shows,
for each shared memory location in the program that was written, what thread
and instruction last wrote it.  These are useful when debugging crashes.
Last writer slices are stored in the program's memory map, so on a crash, 
the last writer slices are preserved with the core dump.  Last writer slices
can be collected very efficiently, so they can be collected during production
runs with extremely low overhead (0-10% in many useful cases).

2)Expose "communication traps".  When exposing communication traps,
CTraps collects last writer slices.  When an instrumented shared memory
operation executes, its instrumentation looks at the last writer slice
for the memory location being accessed.  If the last write was performed
by a different thread, a special function called a "communication trap handler"
is called.  Communication trap handlers are registered with the runtime
at program startup.  A communication trap handler can execute arbitrary code.
These handlers are only called when threads communicate with one another.  
Communication is infrequent, so the overhead of these traps 
is often low enough for use in production code.  The benefit of these traps
is that a developer can: 1)dynamically profile thread sharing; 2)dynamically
tune how threads interact to improve performance; 3)identify likely bugs
manifesting as yet-unseen communication between threads.  There are likely
many other uses for these traps as well.
