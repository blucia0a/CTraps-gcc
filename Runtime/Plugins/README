This document describes how to build a plugin that can be loaded by CTraps
instrumentation.  Your plugin can specify actions that should be taken on
program start and end, thread start and end, and on instrumented communicating
read and write operations.  For information on how to load a plugin into
CTraps, see ../../README.

To build a plugin, copy null_plugin.c, and change the method stubs to implement 
what you want your plugin to do.

TODO: Add plugin support for calling plugin function on non-communicating
instrumented memory accesses.
